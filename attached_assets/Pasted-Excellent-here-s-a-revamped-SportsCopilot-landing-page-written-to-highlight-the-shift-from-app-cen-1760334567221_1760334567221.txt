Excellent — here’s a revamped SportsCopilot landing page written to highlight the shift from app-centric SaaS to agent-centric Smart AI, while keeping your authentic, personal tone.
It reframes SportsCopilot not as another tool, but as an autonomous training companion that works for you — the athlete.

🧠 SportsCopilot — Your Smart Training Agent

Struggling to stay on track with your training?

“It doesn’t have to be this hard.”

There are endless apps that promise to make athletes better — workout trackers, stat sheets, AI dashboards.
But they all expect you to do the work. You log the data. You read the stats. You plan the next move.

That’s the app-centric era — where athletes operate the tools.

Welcome to the agent-centric era.

Where the tools operate for you.

SportsCopilot isn’t another app — it’s your Smart Training Agent.
It learns how you train, tracks your progress automatically, and adapts your plan as you evolve.
No dashboards to babysit. No spreadsheets to update.
Your Copilot observes, analyzes, and responds — just like a real coach would.

It helps you:
	•	Grade your current performance
	•	Analyze gaps holding you back
	•	Map a training plan tailored to your body and schedule
	•	Engage you daily with personalized feedback and adjustments

That’s the G.A.M.E. Framework — your guided path to consistent athlete growth.

🎯 The Athlete’s Smart Agent

SportsCopilot isn’t built for pros with teams of trainers.
It’s built for real athletes — students, workers, and dreamers juggling life and late-night practices.

Your Copilot works behind the scenes:
	•	Player Evaluation Agent → Reviews your skills, health, and mindset
	•	Performance Gaps Agent → Pinpoints what’s limiting your progress
	•	Training Plan Agent → Builds structured drills and recovery roadmaps
	•	Performance Monitoring Agent → Keeps you accountable and adjusting in real time

No fluff. No overthinking. Just steady, intelligent progress — on autopilot.

Would you like me to follow up with a matching section layout wireframe (headline, subheadline, CTA, visual flow) that shows how this new agent-centric message should appear on your landing page — e.g. hero banner → contrast section → G.A.M.E. framework → agents → CTA?
