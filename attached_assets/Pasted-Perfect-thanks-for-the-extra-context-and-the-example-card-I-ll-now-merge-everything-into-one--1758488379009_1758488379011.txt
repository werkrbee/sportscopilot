Perfect — thanks for the extra context and the example card. I’ll now **merge everything** into one unified **Replit prompt** that:

* Uses **React** for the front end.
* Adopts a **minimalist design philosophy** (simplicity = genius, Dorsey method).
* Uses **tone inspired by 37signals** (direct, clear, no fluff).
* Incorporates your **SportsCopilot copy, agent system, ActionPlan philosophy**.
* Generates **drill cards** like the one in your example.
* Supports **content cascading** (hooks to mobile apps).

## 📝 Replit Prompt

**Prompt:**
Build a **mobile-first landing page for SportsCopilot.com** using **React + TailwindCSS** as the front-end framework.

### Design Philosophy

* Inspired by **Albert Einstein**’s belief that simplicity is the highest form of intellect.
* Guided by **Jack Dorsey’s method**: *“Make every single detail perfect. And limit the number of details.”*
* Tone and communication should match **37signals** (Jason Fried & DHH): direct, honest, no fluff.

### Page Requirements

**1. Hero Section (above the fold)**

* Headline: *“Stop Guessing. Start Training with Purpose.”*
* Subheadline: *“SportsCopilot is your personalized sports assistant — evaluating your game, recommending the right drills, and building ActionPlans to keep you consistent and motivated.”*
* CTA Button: *“Build My ActionPlan”*

**2. Value Proposition Section (Agents)**

* Show three clean blocks with icons + text:

  * **AssessmentAgent** – *“Know where you stand.”*
  * **DrillAgent** – *“Get the right drills, every time.”*
  * **CoachAgent** – *“Turn practice into progress.”*
* Wrap-up tagline: *“Together, they create your personalized ActionPlan.”*

**3. Agency Philosophy Section**

* Copy: *“At SportsCopilot, we believe in agency — the responsibility we each have to improve and achieve more. We don’t take our cues from others; we own our journey. But greatness isn’t built alone. SportsCopilot is your expert companion — keeping you consistent, motivated, and on track for the long haul.”*
* Highlight quote (large font, centered): *“Agency means you own the journey. SportsCopilot helps you stay on it.”*

**4. Content Cascade Section**

* Copy: *“SportsCopilot keeps you engaged by cascading content to your favorite apps — so your drills, ActionPlans, and motivation are always within reach. Sync reminders to your calendar, get notifications in your messaging apps, or track consistency through your fitness apps.”*
* Include a mobile mockup showing a sample notification:
  *“🏀 Daily Drill Reminder: 10 minutes of ball-handling — stay sharp!”*

**5. Drill Card Example Section**

* Create a **minimalist drill card component** inspired by the attached example:

  * White background
  * Thin black border
  * Bold black title text (e.g., SHOOTING)
  * Red subtitle (e.g., BASKETBALL DRILL)
  * Simple line art icon (basketball + hoop)
  * Instruction text (e.g., “10 makes from 5 spots”)
* Keep it modular so multiple cards can be displayed in a grid.

**6. Final CTA Section**

* Headline: *“Be your own coach — with a Copilot by your side.”*
* Subheadline: *“Start building the consistency and confidence you need to level up your game.”*
* CTA Button: *“Start My Free ActionPlan Today”*

### Styling & Feel

⚡️ Extra: Add **stub integration points** (JSON endpoint/webhooks) for cascading content (e.g., drills → calendar → messaging apps).

👉 This prompt tells Replit to generate the **entire React landing page with your copy, philosophy, design, and drill cards built in.**

Do you want me to also **draft the component structure** (like `Hero.js`, `ValueProps.js`, `DrillCard.js`, etc.) so the generated code is modular and ready to expand?
